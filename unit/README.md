### 2. Write unit tests for the `sw-client.js` library using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

The goal of this exercise is to write unit tests for the Star Wars API client.
The client can be found in `./js/sw-client.js` and by now it should have three funtions:
`getAllPlanets()`, `getPlanet(<planetId>)` and the function you added in `2.` of the assignment.

The client is functional and connects to the API served under [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/).
