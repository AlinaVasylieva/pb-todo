### 1. Write automated tests for the TO-DO application using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io).

Please focus on the quality of your solution, rather than trying to add a ton of coverage. The goal is to showcase your coding skills
and aiming for full coverage will take more of your time without adding more value. We care mostly about how you approach the problem,
how you structure your code and the overall quality of the solution.

Feel free to get creative and come up with something cool beyond what's defined by the assignment if you want to impress us ðŸš€

Bonus points if you can configure the tests to run on a CI provider of your choice.
