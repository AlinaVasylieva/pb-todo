### This exercise has two goals:

1. Write automated tests for the TO-DO application that's located under the `e2e` directory using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io)
2. Write unit tests for the `sw-client.js` library that's located under the `unit` directory using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

Inside each of the two directories, you will find further instructions about the specific component of the exercise and instructions
on how to get setup, run the app (if applicable) and how to run the tests.


The main idea is to showcase your skills, so rather than trying to add a lot of coverage, which can be time consuming, please focus rather on
showing what you can do ðŸ’ª

There is no maximum timeframe to complete this assignment so feel free to take as much time as you need to prepare something you're proud of ðŸš€
